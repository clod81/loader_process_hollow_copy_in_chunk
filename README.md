# C# loader that copies a chunk at the time of the shellcode in memory of a suspended process, rather that all at once

Based on the Process Hollowing technique

Uses p/invoke to copy an encoded shellcode in memory, 100 bytes (chunks) at the time, rather than all at once

Yes the code is shit, but meh so what - not like I have the whole day to write good pocs

Tested with Meterpreter staged rev HTTPS payload (`encode_shellcode.cs` is the code I used to encode the raw one)
